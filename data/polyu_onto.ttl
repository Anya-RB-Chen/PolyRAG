The content of this course is divided into several phases. We review the relationship between culture and politics through the well-known Yan'an era and its deep impact on cultural production in the People's Republic, particularly in the period of the Cultural Revolution. The \"scar literature\" and the 1990s mass culture were born in a drastically different social and economic transformation. We will take time to investigate popular culture in the context of social stratification of society in the reform era. What role does popular culture play in social transformation? What values does it embody? Is popular culture capable of critique and challenging the dominant social value system?" ;

Besides, most psychological practitioners practice in an institutional context, with policy makers, management, and frontline staff. In this connection, practitioners of psychology will need to effect inter- professional dialogues, consider practice and ethical issues from different value stances, perspectives, and organizational levels, and make a professional judgment as to what is to be done. It is therefore believed that if psychological practice is well-connected with other points of professional contacts in the help system, expected service outcomes will be achieved and greater impact produced in terms of managing the financial costs of care, improving the working environments for care professionals, and ultimately, serving to provide a better model in delivering comprehensive and holistic care." ;

This subject starts from the general discussion about the current functioning of the family system in Hong Kong, and moves on to the study of the relationships between parenting and child development, with special focus on the impacts of family policy in this respect. Family policies in foreign countries such as the Sure Start and Every Child Matters in England would be cited as the reference for international comparison. There would be two key strands of study. The first is the practices and policies relating to parenting. Practical solutions to marital dissolution would also be discussed with special attention to the changing nature of love and intimacy. Another is also related to the discussion about the possibility and feasibility of policies advocating equal parenting and family mediation. Domestic violence is another issue examined in this course. This subject would be concluded with the discussion on the policy and practice pertinent to the issues arising from working parents, gender inequality within and without families, and single-parent families." ;

To expand its domestic market and place less emphasis on export growth, innovative technological companies are emerging with new jobs and revenues created. Among the many technopreneurial industries, China's ICT industry is the largest manufacturing sector within the Chinese economy. Very often, Beijing's Zhongguancun is often hailed as China's new Silicon Valleys. The objectives of this subject are to introduce students of the significance of entrepreneurship and use the China ICT experience to elaborate the entrepreneurial process - from identifying innovations, evaluating good business opportunities to new venture start-up and growth issues, and proper entrepreneurial behaviour which is a critical success factor in new venture creation. This subject will first begin with the discussion of the entrepreneurial process in China. It then reviews how China has attained its leading position and presents a China's ICT development model with specific reference to the experiences of East Asian 'tigers'. It continues to show how the development of the IT industry was military-driven before 1978, and how subsequently Chinese policymakers, struggling with domestic market reform and challenged by trade liberalisation and globalisation, managed to push through ICT development strategies. Students will also learn about the recent advancement of IT developments in China. Assignments and projects will be centered on understanding of the innovative ideas and the processes for the established IT entrepreneurial companies in China. Case studies, invited speakers and company visits will be arranged to assist students to know the most recent on-going activities in this area." ;

The basis of the theory was developed in 1948 by Claude Shannon, and is called information theory. Amazingly and surprisingly, Shannon theory stated that reliable communication without any error is possible over a noisy channel. By the mid 1970's, mainstream systems using information theoretic ideas began to be widely implemented because of the increasing number of engineers who understood both information theory and communication system practice. Since then, wireless communication technologies have been more and more powerful. For example, in the first-generation (1G) cellular systems, the phones can only be used for a call with very poor quality. Now, the fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems can even support 4K live streaming in virtual reality (VR). It is thus important to understand how the connection between communication theory and engineering design leads to the success of the current communication systems." ;

It brings together communication skills and reflective practice on being an effective manager. It explores the multifaceted tasks and responsibilities that managers must undertake. It emphasizes the need for managers to be able to work with their staff to solve a range of diverse concerns including human resourceng, workflow structures and personal work relationships. Managers need to draw on their communication skills to avert possible conflicts and to engage their staff to work harmoniously together. Communication skills are often learned on the job when a person is promoted to a management position. The result is that many people who have the potential to be effective managers, fail because they have not learned the basic communication skills that all effective managers need to employ. The subject has relevance for all students entering the professional workforce and, irrespective of their chosen professions (engineering, accountancy or nursing) provides them with skills to negotiate and manage workplace responsibilities. Students will be introduced to a basic management communication issues around managing change in the workplace, the communication of leadership and workplace conflict. They will be introduced to issues around managing the virtual team and the many types of workplace diversity that now confront today's managers. Learning these skills while at university will equip them with knowledge that will enable them to aspire to management positions.

For each of these issues, they will determine i) the rhetorical/argumentative objectives of discourse producers, ii) the role of metaphor in supporting these objectives, and iii) the effects on discourse receivers (i.e. the general public).

This helps make sense of the linguistic situations and phenomena through local perspectives and provides a framework for examining how language and dialectal diversity is managed in homes, businesses, and communities.

Students are also helped to understand the limitations of traditional grammar and the importance of functional analysis, particularly at the level of discourse. Students explore applications of grammar, including the role of grammar in the creation of registers and genres. Grammar here is viewed as part of a larger language system encompassing meaning and discourse. In this respect, the subject has clear affinities with other subjects that focus on semantics, lexis and discourse." ;

Leisure changes from culture to culture, from era to era, and from one stage of life to another. It is this complexity of leisure we hope to pursue through this general introductory subject. The subject deals with the meanings of leisure and the consequences of leisure participation in a modern society. It examines the origins and evolution of leisure as a socio-cultural phenomenon and as an inter-/multi-disciplinary branch of social sciences. Various theories and conceptualizations of leisure are reviewed and discussed in its connection to work and stress, time use, leisure satisfaction and health, quality of life and well-being, community and culture, gender and sexuality, pleasure travel, agencies and policies, and creativity and personal development for individuals in a modern society. In addition to the benefits of leisure participation, the subject also looks at leisure constraints, particularly for populations with special needs, as well as societal trends and demographic shifts that will shape the future of leisure behavior and free time pursuits in our increasingly leisure- oriented communities and/or societies. In short, this general introductory subject aims to provide an overview of the wide spectrum of leisure from various social sciences perspectives. It introduces students (of various disciplines or specializations) to the nature and scope of leisure, leisure behavior, and the consequences of its development (or under-development) in a modern society. As such, the subject's contents are primarily theoretical accounts, informed by the ever-growing body of inter- /multi-disciplinary social sciences scholarship known as leisure studies. Notably, due to the institution's location and students' backgrounds, the policies, planning and development practices of leisure and recreation in Hong Kong will be used as case studies or" ;

Traditionally, logistics means the organised movement of goods, services, information and people from the point of origin to the point of consumption. The scope of logistics has been growing rapidly since the last few decades with the advance of technology. It has also been estimated that logistics costs account for one third of the cost of doing business. Effective logistics management is hence crucial for the success of the company. This course provides an introduction to logistics and distribution management and aims at providing students with a full understanding of business logistics management, transport, inventory and distribution systems supported with real business case studies. It includes the analysis of modern business logistics management strategies, and discusses how products and services are created and delivered to the customers effectively. Besides, the course covers the management of the logistics system operations in this information era, and the effectively utilisation of the information technology concepts to gain a competitive advantage of the company." ;

This course primarily focuses on two jurisdictions, which are London and Hong Kong. London is claimed as the largest international maritime arbitration forum due to its popularity of its specific contractual clauses in terms of maritime arbitration. Hong Kong, with the advantage of its intimate relation with China, is able to withstand the competition by providing supportive and efficient arbitration service with an international element. The course introduces the New Arbitration Ordinance (LHK Cap. 609), which is enacted in 2011, and analyzes how it is different to the Repealed Arbitration Ordinance (LHK Cap. 341). The course encourages analytical and evaluative discussions on the comparison between the Hong Kong and London regimes on maritime arbitration.

    base:has_subject_description "The subject is designed for students who are interested in gaining a more advanced level of understanding of the planning and implementation of various promotional vehicles. The subject is aimed to contribute to the MSc in Marketing Management Programme Outcomes in two ways. First, the content directly addresses the principles and practices of marketing, solving promotion problems in practice, and designing marketing strategies for the digital era. Second, the classroom activities and assessments develop students' teamwork and expertise in promotion and advertising Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) was a concept that emerged in the 80's when advertising alone was no longer sufficient or the most cost-effective way to promote a brand or to drive sales growth. As a result, marketers have started to diversify their marketing effort to cover sales promotions, public relations, and direct marketing, etc., in response to the changing marketing landscape and consumer lifestyle. Yet \"co-existence\" is not the same as \"integration\". For example, having different marketing elements in the marketing plan does not always produce a genuine and workable integrated marketing plan. That is why it is paramount for marketers and business operators to understand the barriers to implementing IMC, of which a significant part of the issue is related to internal policy, corporate culture, and business practice. IMC has also been re-defined following the paradigm shift from the conventional marketing approach to a more customized and fluid model in the digital age. As such, it is critical for any enterprise to embrace the concept of IMC in its current state and be able to apply the key IMC principles in the planning, implementing, measuring, and managing of marketing activities in a holistic manner. This course is structured to examine the concept and evolution of IMC thoroughly by analyzing the values of each medium or discipline with a focus on advertising which is still accounting for a significant portion of the marketing investment, although the form of advertising has been extended to social media and various digital platforms in recent years. Considerable effort will also be dedicated to investigating the impact of technology and big data on how they can add value to the new marketing ecosystem.
